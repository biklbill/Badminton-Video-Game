# Badminton-Video-Game
A game called BAFA a friend and I are making using Unity. I am in charge of the programming, my friend is in charge of the arts and design. Still under development.

The core gameplay is largely complete and functional. However, the drop shot mechanics require further refinement to improve their logic, and the associated animations for the core gameplay still need additional development.

Key game systems that require development:
- Game database
- User interface
- Main lobby
- Player cards
- Game levels and stages
- Multiplayer (future development phase)

The app of the game itself is in the Badminton game app folder, called BAFA main.exe. It takes the player directly to the core gameplay experience, which is fully playable.

The code of the game is in the Badminton game code folder. The core gameplay resides in the Game.unity scene and can be executed to perform gameplay testing. The editor version is 6000.1.9f1.
