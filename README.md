A game called BAFA a friend and I are making using Unity. I am in charge of the programming, my friend is in charge of the arts and design. Still under development.

The core gameplay is largely complete and functional. However, the drop shot mechanics require further refinement to improve their logic, and the associated animations for the core gameplay still need additional development.

Key game systems that require development:
- Game database
- User interface
- Main lobby
- Player cards
- Game levels and stages
- Multiplayer (future development phase)
